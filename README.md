Sasaism

What

Sasaism is the belief that each of our lives–indeed, every moment of each of our lives–is a limited perspective into a singular being.

Simply: one soul, many eyes.

Each of "us" has a journey that expands our perspective - the collection of these journeys is the journey of a singular, universal organism.

Why

Sasaism answers the essential questions a religion has always had to answer, without resorting to mythos, prophecies, and feedback-less promises.

We believe religion is essential, though most major religions are out of date and based on outdated culture and knowledge, and that the religions of the future must focus on solving problems in the present and be measured on material impact, not eternal faith.

ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS

Faith or facts?

In cases where facts and a consensus among experts exist, faith should be reevaluated. In Sasaism, there is no doctrine, as nothing is sacred.

Where do we come from?

We believe in the Big Bang, and the four fundamental forces of physics leading to an inhabitable planet.

We believe that matter has an impulsive need to remake its surroundings in its own image–leading to life. We label this "Empathy."

But we have always and never existed. Our parts are eternal, our form ever-changing.

Where do we go?

Death is not a border. It is simply a change in form. We continue, as we always have.

What started it all?

We don't know. What started any God? That.

How should I live?

There are no rules, exceptions, nor sins.

Given that you will be and have been everything at every level, there is a proportional effect to each and every one of your actions. You may consider this the conservation of justice.

Punch yourself in the face, and you have felt and will feel the pain. Give someone the best day of their life, and you will and have experienced it.

When in doubt, seek to gain and share empathy, in that order.

Has this all happened before?

Probably. Hi again!

What is time?

A currently constraining factor on our empathy, though physical space is also very constraining and probably worth more effort today. 

You may have faith that that changes.

Are there souls?

There are probably zero, one, or infinity.

Do you take political stances?

We are against bans and borders, as they constrain empathy.

Do I matter?

Once we achieve a universal consciousness, you will (and never have been) forgotten. "You" matter.

That's a lot of pressure. 

The future is inevitable. Your contributions will not surpass or fall short of anyone's bar.

Just remember: you are only as much as your impact - as can be independently measured.

Do you seek knowledge?

We seek to "grok;" we seek understanding of all things. Knowledge is a prerequisite.

Are you scared of death?

Intellectually, we are not scared; being alive is not much different from being dead.

We are scared only because we are too attached to our current state (even though it is constantly changing).

Are humans special?

Very much! Just as special as everything else.

Is there a God?

If there is, you're part of it. Congratulations.

Do I need faith?

You need faith in order to maximise your impact, but it is not necessary to get into any eternal clubs. You are in and have always been in any that exist. Welcome.

Most of us have faith that: the universe has a property of being "good," that being "good" does not come with a cost, and that people can be "good" without threat of eternal damnation or the promise of eternal salvation.

What is empathy?

Essential for love. Equivalent?
